## Installation Instructions  
Go to the github repo provided below and download the code. Make sure to run 'npm install express uuid'. Then run 'npm start'. 
The console log will let you know the hhtp://localhost:3001 is ready to be used in a web browser and or insomnia. 
From there feel free to make notes, save and delete as you please. 

## Process
Cloned the starter code. I was expecting it to be much more similar to zookeepr *module work*, so I set up the code from that activity to get started. 
I was WRONG and overcomplicated it for myself. After meeting with my tutor, I realized it would be a much simpler structure and I did not needs tests, library, multiple route folders, etc. Once I cleaned up the structure, I found the router was not as neccessary because there were not as many files/databases/etc so I changed my code from router to app. Then I thought I was getting somewhere, but was running into error after error. I kept restructing my code thinking I was calling things in the wrong order, but it turned out I forgot to install uuid üôÑ THEN it was working as intended.
